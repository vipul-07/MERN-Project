# MERN-Project
Node JS most famous framework is`Express`. Many developer recommends `express` framework to write the back-end code. People are using express because it is `customizable backend scripting language`, code can be written in pure js (ES5 or ES6).

In this project we have used Express REST API and ReactJs for frontend.
